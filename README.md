# FoodIsGood-Orbital2022
## About FoodIsGood:
We wanted to create a mobile application for students in NUS who wanted to try new food and wanted to minimize the risk of having a bad experience to
view food reviews given by other students allowing them to make an informed decision on what to purchase. 

## Features of FoodIsGood:
FoodIsGood allows users to create their own accounts using an email and a password. This is done with the assistance of Supabase Auth.  
Users can create their own usernames.  
View and upvote food reviews posted by other students.  
Create their own food reviews based on taste, value for money as well as write a short description about the food.  
Edit or delete reviews they have posted.
